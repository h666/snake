HTML5 Snake

My first memorable game.  

As a learning exercise I have decided to try and recreate this classic.  At first purely as a html5 canvas using keyboard.  With further goals to possibly enable joypad support, mobile support (some sort dynamic canvas resizing? possibly)  however for a novice as myself these are lofty goals!

Any thoughts/suggestions/comments are most welcome.

Thank you
